/*========= Description =========*/

Quicksand is a clean, flexible and responsive theme based on the standard theme TwentySixteen.

Its responsive design is based on Bootstrap 4, so your page will always look fine on any device. Quicksand also comes with a social icon integration, using the fantastic Font Awesome. You are able to apply Google-Fonts, galleries can be displayed by the awesome plugin Lightgallery & if you feel to use a slider on your frontpage, no worries, Flexslider is integrated. For the nerds of you, there are also sass-files and a grunt-file included.
